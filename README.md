## Project Life Cycle 
The Project Lifecycle consists of seven phases intake, initiation, planning, product selection, execution, monitoring & control, and closure. These phases make up the path that takes your project from start to finish.

### Intake Life Cycle
Project Intake is a process of reviewing and evaluating a proposed project during the initiation phase. The purpose is to confirm that the project is feasible and aims to address the stated problem. The process is also intended to review the organizational structure of the proposed project to define whether allocated human resources are sufficient and available for doing the project and producing desired deliverables.
